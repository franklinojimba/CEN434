                <h2>My First Time Coding Something Big</h2>
                <p class="post-meta">Posted on October 28, 2025 by Franklin</p>
                <p>I just finished building my first ever website! It's so simple, but it feels like a massive achievement. I used HTML for the structure and CSS for the colors and layout. It took me a whole afternoon, but seeing it work on my phone was the best feeling. I learned a lot about how to make things look good on different screen sizes, which was way harder than I thought it would be. Next up, I want to try adding some basic interactivity with JavaScript. Wish me luck!</p>

                <h2>The Power of a Simple To-Do List</h2>
                <p class="post-meta">Posted on October 26, 2025 by Franklin</p>
                <p>Sometimes, the easiest tools are the best. I used to rely on fancy apps, but lately, a simple handwritten to-do list has changed my life. There's something very satisfying about crossing off a task with a pen. It helps me focus and not get distracted by all the other things my computer and phone try to show me. I think this simplicity is a principle I want to bring into my coding projects too. Less complexity, more focus on the main goal.</p>

                <h2>Favorite Recipe of the Week: Lemon Pasta</h2>
                <p class="post-meta">Posted on October 22, 2025 by Franklin</p>
                <p>If you need a quick, bright meal, you have to try this recipe. It’s just pasta, lemon juice, zest, butter, and a bit of parmesan. It sounds simple, but the flavor is incredible and it takes less than 20 minutes to make from start to finish. I always add a pinch of red pepper flakes for a tiny bit of heat. Perfect for a busy weeknight. I’ll share the exact steps in another post soon!</p>
